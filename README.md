# Social Media Performance Analysis

A basic analytics module leveraging **LangFlow** and **DataStax Astra DB** to analyze engagement data from mock social media accounts. It features a Streamlit-based web application for interacting with LangFlow-generated workflows for performance analysis.

## Tools Used:
- **DataStax Astra DB** for database operations.
- **LangFlow** for workflow creation and GPT integration.
- **Streamlit** for providing a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features:
- **LangFlow and DataStax-Powered:** Robust and accurate social media performance analysis.
- **Interactive Interface:** Chat-driven analysis for deeper insights.
- **Query History:** Persistent session history using Streamlit's `session_state`.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Quick and intuitive feedback on social media performance.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RohanMalakar/Insightify
cd Insightify
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Set up a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  source env/Scripts/activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the projectâ€™s root directory and add the following:
```
APP_TOKEN=<your-langflow-token>
```
Replace `<your-langflow-token>` with the API token generated by LangFlow.

### 5. Run the Application
Launch the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How to Use:
1. Enter your query in the text input field.
2. Click the **Generate Insights** button to process your query.
3. View the analysis results and chat history displayed below the input area.

## Project Structure:
- **app.py:** Main application file containing Streamlit logic.
- **requirements.txt:** File listing all necessary dependencies.
- **.env:** File for securely storing environment variables.

## Demo
